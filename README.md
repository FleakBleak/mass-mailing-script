# Mass Email Sending Script

This repository contains a script to send personalized emails based on information provided in a CSV file. The CSV file should have two columns: "email" and "name". The "email" column contains email addresses, and the "name" column contains the corresponding names of the recipients. The script uses this information to send an email to each address, addressing each recipient by their name.
